    summary: >-
      Internal resource version. This is defined per-resource and is used to
      support build-to-build compatibility of API changes within a given
      (in-preview) public api version. For example, within the TFS 1.0 API
      release cycle, while it is still in preview, a resource's data structure
      may be changed. This resource can be versioned such that older clients
      will still work (requests will be sent to the older version) and
      new/upgraded clients will talk to the new version of the resource.
