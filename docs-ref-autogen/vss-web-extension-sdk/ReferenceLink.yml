    summary: >-
      The class to represent a REST reference link.  Example: { self: { href:
      "http://localhost:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection/_apis/wit/workItems/1" } } 
      RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-06  The RFC is not
      fully implemented, additional properties are allowed on the reference link
      but as of yet we don't have a need for them.
