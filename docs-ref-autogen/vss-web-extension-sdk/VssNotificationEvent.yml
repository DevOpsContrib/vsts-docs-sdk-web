      This is the type used for firing notifications intended for the subsystem
      in the Notifications SDK. For components that can't take a dependency on
      the Notifications SDK directly, they can use
      ITeamFoundationEventService.PublishNotification and the Notifications SDK
      ISubscriber implementation will get it.
