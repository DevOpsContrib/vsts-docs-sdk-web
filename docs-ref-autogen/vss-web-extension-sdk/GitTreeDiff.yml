      List of tree entries that differ between the base and target tree. 
      Renames and object type changes are returned as a delete for the old
      object and add for the new object.  If a continuation token is returned in
      the response header, some tree entries are yet to be processed and may
      yeild more diff entries. If the continuation token is not returned all the
      diff entries have been included in this response.
